## Description
`QAToolKit.Core` is a .NET Standard 2.1 library, that contains core objects and functions of the toolkit. It's normally not used as a standalone library but is a dependency for other QAToolKit libraries.

## 1. HttpRequest functions
HttpRequest object is one of the main objects that is shared among the QA Toolkit libraries. `QAToolKit.Core` library contains `HttpRequestTools` which can manipulate the HttpRequest object.

For example URL, header and Body generators: `HttpRequestUrlGenerator`, `HttpRequestBodyGenerator` and `HttpRequestHeaderGenerator`.

### 1.1. HttpRequestUrlGenerator
This is a method that will accept key/value pairs for replacement of placeholders in the `HttpRequest` object. Replacement object are stored in a dictionary, which `prevents mistakes with duplicated keys`.
Also dictionary keys are case insensitive when looking for values to replace.

```csharp
options.AddReplacementValues(new Dictionary<string, object> {
    {
        "version",
        "1"
    },
    {
        "parentId",
        "4"
    }
});
```

In the example above we say: "Replace `{version}` and {parentId} placeholders in Path and URL parameters and JSON body models."

In other words, if you have a test API endpoint like this: https://api.demo.com/v{version}/categories?parent={parentId} that will be set to https://api.demo.com/v1/categories?parent=4.

That, does not stop there, you can also populate JSON request bodies.

### 1.2. HttpRequestBodyGenerator

For example if you set the replacement value to stringified json:

```csharp
options.AddReplacementValues(new Dictionary<string, object> {
    {
        "id",
        "100"
    },
    {
        "category",
        "{\"id\":1,\"name\":\"dog\"}"
    }
});
```
than the parent model object will be replaced with the stringified json above.

What happend behind the curtains, the model proxy class is generated, which is then used to Deserialized the JSON into the object.
`HttpRequest` list is then scanned and values are properly replaced.

### 1.3. HttpRequestHeaderGenerator

To-do

## 2. To-do

- `HttpRequestHeaderGenerator` is missing implementation.
- `HttpRequestBodyGenerator` need to cover the whole spectrum of object tipes. Currently it's missing arrays, and nested objects. It's on the priority list.
